# Circumbinary Habitable Research
This repository contains data and analysis for a research project on the habitability of circumbinary planets. The research proposal, final report, and Jupyter notebooks used for data generation and habitability analysis are included in this repository.

## Research Overview
In the last decade, NASA's Kepler and TESS missions have enabled the detection of exoplanets, revealing many worlds that differ significantly from planets in our Solar System, including more than 900 planets in multi-planetary systems. The Kepler circumbinary planets (CBPs) exist in a dynamic environment, which differs from planets orbiting single stars. This broadens our understanding of exoplanet diversity and motivates the exploration of their habitability in complex binary systems.

Identifying habitable zones (HZs) in circumbinary systems is difficult because of the interplay between disrupted planetary orbits and fluctuating stellar radiation. A solution to this challenge has been proposed through the concept of Dynamically Informed Habitable Zones (DIHZs), which enable the identification of potentially habitable CBPs.

In this study, we provide an overview of current approaches to calculating HZs in circumbinary systems and perform a suite of Monte Carlo experiments using empirical relationships of stellar parameters. Our result demonstrates that circumbinary systems do not necessarily preclude the possibility of habitable planets, with 4.7% of the systems tested being able to support habitable worlds. The habitability and orbital stability of CBPs depend heavily on the primary star mass, orbital period, and eccentricity of binaries.
